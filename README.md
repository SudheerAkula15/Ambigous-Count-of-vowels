# Ambigous_Count_of_vowels
This is the code for counting the vowels 
Where the count is ambigous 
Which means
  For example Tree
   Here the count will be count=1 since 'e' is repeated twice
   Example2: Sudheer
   Here the count will be count=2 since 'e' is repeated twice so count=1 and 'u' is onec so the count is incremented.
   Final count=2.
